# HH.ru interaction bot

- Some good features are in my mind, but only few of them are implemented
- This bot currently can authenticate user on hh.ru, and transform chosen resume to international format
- Both `.tex` and `.pdf` files will be sent after request.
- Since tex compiler is kinda heavyweight, compiling might take a couple of minutes.
- All data is obtained via official hh.ru API. Bot is registered as "application", request #7566.
- Authentication is processed by hh.ru itself, so it is safe enough. You can revoke access any time via Settings > My apps on hh.ru website.
